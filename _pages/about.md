## <a id="about"></a>About

Hello! I’m Robert, a Ph.D. candidate in the Aerospace Engineering Department at CU Boulder. I’m currently part of the ARIA Systems group advised by Dr. Morteza Lahijanian. 
My research in this group focuses on how to use machine learning techniques to improve the scalability of formal methods, in particular I consider the case where the dynamics of the system are not well defined due to unmodeled/black-box components and reason about how to learn an verify a model from data.
