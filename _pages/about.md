## <a id="about"></a>About

Hello! I’m Robert, a Ph.D. candidate in the Aerospace Engineering Department at CU Boulder. I’m currently part of the [ARIA Systems group](https://ariasystems.group/index.html) advised by Dr. [Morteza Lahijanian](https://mortezalahijanian.com/index.html). Check out our [github repo](https://github.com/aria-systems-group) to see what we've been up to. 
Prior to joining ARIA Systems, I spent two years working as a Controls Engineer at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab. My work there expanded my interests in control theory and encouraged me to delve into research for autonomous systems.

My current research focuses on how to use machine learning techniques to improve the scalability of formal methods. In particular, I consider cases where the dynamics of the system are not well defined due to unmodeled/black-box components and reason about how to learn and verify a model from data. My regression model of choice is the Gaussian Process, which has the rigorous uncertainty quantification we need to reason in a formal manner; check out my papers to see how they can be used even without Gaussian noise and how to incorporate a deep architecture to increase their expressivity! Outside of regression, my research interests include Formal Methods, Verification of Autonomous Systems, Control Theory, Reinforcement Learning, and Neural Network Verificaiton.
